# jQuery-inputevent

**A jQuery plugin that provides a cross-browser** `oninput` **event.**

This is fork of the now-defunct [http://whattheheadsaid.com/projects/input-special-event](http://whattheheadsaid.com/projects/input-special-event) (goes **404**).

It fixes some bugs, etc. Documentation to come!
